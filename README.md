# Object-Tracking

In this repository moving objects are seperated from the stationary background. And number of cars that have passed is tracked. 

A region of interest is found where the objects are to be detected because the input is from a wide angled camera. Can be extended to find any moving object in a stationary background.

If You want the input file ping me at **nehalmathew@yahoo.com**
